# Snail

I've been using snail as my only terminal for over a year, but I would not recommend other people use it as part of their critical infrastructure yet. The apis might change before the 1.0 release and I can't garuantee it won't eat your data. That being said, I welcome feedback from the brave!

## Install and run from source
Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
Running snail
```sh
npm start
```
