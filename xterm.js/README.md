# xterm.js

![xterm.js build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/sourcelair/xterm.js.svg)

Xterm.js is a full xterm clone, written in JavaScript.

It is used at [SourceLair](https://www.sourcelair.com/home) to help people develop their applications in their browsers.

Xterm.js supplies a modular, event-based interface that lets developers build addons and themes on top of it.

## Browser Support

Since xterm.js is typically implemented as a developer tool, only modern browsers are supported officially. Here is a list of the versions we aim to support: 

- Chrome 48+
- Edge 13+
- Firefox 44+
- Internet Explorer 11+
- Opera 35+
- Safari 8+

xterm.js may work on earlier versions of the browsers but these are the browsers we strive to keep working.

## Demo

To launch the demo simply run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://0.0.0.0:3000 in a web browser (use http://127.0.0.1:3000 is running under Windows).

## Addons

Addons are JavaScript modules that attach functions to the `Terminal` prototype to extend its functionality. There are a handful available in the main repository in the `addons` directory, you can even write your own (though they may break when the internals of xterm.js change across versions).

To use an addon, just include the JavaScript file after xterm.js and before the `Terminal` object has been instantiated. The function should then be exposed on the `Terminal` object:

```html
<script src="node_modules/src/xterm.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/addons/linkify/linkify.js"></script>
```

```js
var xterm = new Terminal();
// init code...
xterm.linkify();
```
