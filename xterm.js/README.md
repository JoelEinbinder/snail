Xterm.js is a terminal front-end component written in JavaScript that works in the browser.

It enables applications to provide fully featured terminals to their users and create great development experiences.

## Features
- **Text-based application support**: Use xterm.js to work with applications like `bash`, `git` etc.
- **Curses-based application support**: Use xterm.js to work with applications like `vim`, `tmux` etc.
- **Mouse events support**: Xterm.js captures mouse events like click and scroll and passes them to the terminal's back-end controlling process
- **CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) character support**: Xterm.js renders CJK characters seamlessly
- **IME support**: Insert international (including CJK) characters using IME input with your keyboard
- **Self-contained library**: Xterm.js works on its own. It does not require any external libraries like jQuery or React to work
- **Modular, event-based API**: Lets you build addons and themes with ease

## What xterm.js is not
- Xterm.js is not a terminal application that you can download and use on your computer
- Xterm.js is not `bash`. Xterm.js can be connected to processes like `bash` and let you interact with them (provide input, receive output)

## Getting Started

First you need to install the module, we ship exclusively through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) so you need that installed and then add xterm.js as a dependency by running:

```
npm install
```

To start using xterm.js on your browser, add the `xterm.js` and `xterm.css` to the head of your html page. Then create a `<div id="terminal"></div>` onto which xterm can attach itself.

```html
<!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/xterm/dist/xterm.css" />
      <script src="node_modules/xterm/dist/xterm.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="terminal"></div>
      <script>
      	var term = new Terminal();
        term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));
        term.write('Hello from \033[1;3;31mxterm.js\033[0m $ ')
      </script>
    </body>
  </html>
```

Finally instantiate the `Terminal` object and then call the `open` function with the DOM object of the `div`.

### Addons

Addons are JavaScript modules that attach functions to the `Terminal` prototype to extend its functionality. There are a handful available in the main repository in the `dist/addons` directory, you can even write your own (though they may break when the internals of xterm.js change across versions).

To use an addon, just include the JavaScript file after xterm.js and before the `Terminal` object has been instantiated. The function should then be exposed on the `Terminal` object:

```html
<script src="node_modules/xterm/dist/xterm.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/xterm/dist/addons/fit/fit.js"></script>
```

```js
// Instantiate the terminal and call fit
var xterm = new Terminal();
xterm.fit();
```

### Importing

If the environment allows it, you can import xterm.js like so:

```ts
// CommonJS
var Terminal = require('xterm').Terminal;

// ES6 / TypeScript
import { Terminal } from 'xterm';
```

Importing addons in this environment can be done using a `Terminal.loadAddon` call:

```ts
import { Terminal } from 'xterm';

// Notice it's called statically on the type, not an object
Terminal.loadAddon('fit');

// Instantiate the terminal and call fit
var xterm = new Terminal();
xterm.fit();
```

*Note: There are currently no typings for addons so you will need to upcast if using TypeScript, eg. `(<any>xterm).fit()`*

## Browser Support

Since xterm.js is typically implemented as a developer tool, only modern browsers are supported officially. Here is a list of the versions we aim to support:

- Chrome 48+
- Edge 13+
- Firefox 44+
- Internet Explorer 11+
- Opera 35+
- Safari 8+

Xterm.js works seamlessly in Electron apps and may even work on earlier versions of the browsers but these are the browsers we strive to keep working.

## Demo

### Linux or macOS

First, be sure that a C++ compiler such as GCC-C++ or Clang is installed, then run these commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://0.0.0.0:3000 in a web browser.

### Windows

First, ensure [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) is installed and configured correctly, then run these commands.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:3000 in a web browser.

*Note: Do not use ConEmu, as it seems to break the demo for some reason.*

## Releases

Xterm.js follows a monthly release cycle roughly.

The existing releases are available at this GitHub repo's [Releases](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/releases), while the roadmap is available as [Milestones](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/milestones).

## Development and Contribution
